2024 was the first year in a long time that I read fairly consistently. Most of what I read was fiction, which I haven't read much of in many years. I am not going to write a review of each book, but I will give some takeaways.
- *Anathem* was my favorite book of the year and one of my favorite books of all time.
- *Station Eleven* and *Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow* are tied for least favorite. 
- *The Left Hand of Darkness* is superior to *The Dispossessed* in my opinion. 
- Good fiction holds far more perspective, meaning, and wisdom then non-fiction ever can.
- That being said, two of the three non-fiction books on this list have changed the direction of my life.
